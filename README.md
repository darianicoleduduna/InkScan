# InkScan - Features

This project is a web application for recognizing handwritten text from images. The main features are:

- **User authentication and registration**  
  Users can create accounts, log in, and log out.

- **Upload handwritten images**  
  Users can upload images (JPG, JPEG, PNG) containing handwritten text for analysis.

- **Handwriting recognition from images**  
  The application automatically extracts handwritten text from images using advanced OCR models.

- **Automatic text correction**  
  The recognized text is cleaned and automatically corrected.

- **Text-to-speech**  
  Users can listen to the recognized text using speech synthesis functionality.

- **Download results**  
  The recognized text can be downloaded in DOCX or PDF format.

- **Scan history**  
  Each user has access to their history of uploaded images and recognized texts, with options to delete individual entries or clear the entire history.

- **Drawing interface**  
  Users can write by hand directly in the application on an whiteboard, and the drawn text is recognized and processed similarly to uploaded images.

- **Save drawing with watermark**  
  Drawings can be downloaded with a personalized watermark.

These features provide a complete experience for digitizing and managing handwritten text, also acting as an efficient way of storing data, dedicated especially to students.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask** â€“ Web framework for Python.
- **OpenCV** â€“ Image processing and manipulation.
- **EasyOCR** â€“ For word detection and bounding box extraction.
- **TrOCR (Transformers OCR)** â€“ Handwriting recognition using Microsoft's TrOCR model (`microsoft/trocr-large-handwritten`).
- **Pytesseract** â€“ For orientation and script detection.
- **TextBlob** & **language_tool_python** â€“ For automatic text correction.
- **wordninja** â€“ For splitting concatenated words.
- **ReportLab** & **python-docx** â€“ For exporting recognized text as PDF and DOCX.
- **Speech Synthesis (Web Speech API)** â€“ For text-to-speech in the browser.
- **Pillow (PIL)** â€“ Image manipulation and watermarking.
These technologies ensure accurate OCR, robust text correction, and a user-friendly experience.

## Interface

# **1.Login and Sign up** 
Firstly, each user must create an account or connect to an existing one in order to use the app.
